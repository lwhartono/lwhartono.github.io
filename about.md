Hi, I'm Leonard Hartono, most people call me Leo. I like to think of myself as a semi-professional dilettante although there are some areas where I would like to become an expert. Some areas that interest me are data, decision making, causal inference, behavioral economics and the stock market.

I started out as a mechanical engineer designing pumps and since then I've invested in brick & mortar coffee shops, studied and invested using some different investing strategies in the stock market, ran a restaurant, worked as a data scientist and now I am a data manager for Bukalapak, an e-commerce company based in Indonesia.

Over the years, I have come to learn that people are irrational (including me) and we regularly make mistakes in decision making due to our cognitive biases. I think that data or more specifically the right approach to data is a key part of the antidote. This is why I'm in data.
